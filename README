This is a modern theme for Geeklog CMS by Taylor Lapeyre, based on Denim by Yoshinori Tahara.

This theme was built for the website of the Louisiana Biomedical Research Network, and has
code that is explicitly for this network. For the moment, this is not a general Geeklog theme.
A beta version of the site can be found here: http://test.lbrn.lsu.edu/

This theme uses the following frameworks and services:
  - Bootstrap          : http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/
  - bootstrap-wysihtml : https://github.com/jhollingworth/bootstrap-wysihtml5/
  - Symbolset          : https://symbolset.com/

The basic structure of the theme goes soemthing like this:

header.thtml:
  <header>
  <nav>

leftblocks.thtml:
  <div.hero-unit>

centerblocks, etc.thml:
  <div.span9>
    <article.row>
    ...

footer.thtml:
  rightblocks.thtml:
  <div#sidebar.span3>
    <ul.nav-list>
     ...
  <footer>
